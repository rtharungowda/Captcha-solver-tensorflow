Solving computer generated image captcha using tensorflow object detection api.

Object detection is the process of finding instances of real-world objects such as faces, buildings, and bicycle in images or videos. Object detection algorithms typically use extracted features and learning algorithms to recognize instances of an object category. It is commonly used in applications such as image retrieval, security, surveillance, and advanced driver assistance systems (Self-driving cars).

<br/>Tensorflow is an open-source deep learning framework created by Google Brain. Tensorflow’s Object Detection API is a powerful tool which enables everyone to create their own powerful Image Classifiers. No coding or programming knowledge is needed to use Tensorflow’s Object Detection API. But to understand it’s working, knowing python programming and basics of machine learning helps.
